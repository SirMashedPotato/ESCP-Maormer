		<baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was born slightly different to most, even by child standards [PAWN_pronoun] struggled to walk, and was far more at home in the water. Turns out [PAWN_nameDef] was born a leviathan, which became incredibly obvious as [PAWN_pronoun] grew larger, far larger than any child should be. Also [PAWN_possessive] jaw distending when eating may have helped [PAWN_possessive] parents come to that conclusion.\n\n[PAWN_nameDef] is a leviathan, a strange breed of Maormer with a special connection to the storm.</baseDescription>

		<baseDescription>When [PAWN_nameDef] was born, it was apparent [PAWN_pronoun] was different. [PAWN_nameDef] managed to escape from [PAWN_possessive] outpost when the Colovian armies began their attack. Forced to live in the wilds, [PAWN_nameDef] relied on pure animalistic instinct to survive. The inhabitants of nearby fishing villages thought [PAWN_pronoun] was a sea demon, and multiple times attempted to capture [PAWN_possessive].\n\n[PAWN_nameDef] is a leviathan, a strange breed of Maormer with a special connection to the storm.</baseDescription>
