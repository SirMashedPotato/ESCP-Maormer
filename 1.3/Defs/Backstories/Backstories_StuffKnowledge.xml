		<title>master orgnium smith</title>
		<titleShort>master smith</titleShort>
		<baseDescription>Starting from a young age, [PAWN_nameDef] has apprenticed under some of the best smiths found on Pyandonea. Quickly surpassing [PAWN_possessive] mentors, [PAWN_nameDef] was tasked by King Orgnum himself to craft a new set of armour, an honour most never dreamed of. It's said the armour was strong enough to withstand the full might of a serpent's jaws, not that King Orgnum ever needed to worry about that.\n\nAnything [PAWN_nameDef] crafts out of orgnium will be one quality level higher than normal.</baseDescription>

		<title>master buoyant steel smith</title>
		<titleShort>master smith</titleShort>
		<baseDescription>Always obsessed with what lies beneath the waves, one day [PAWN_nameDef] learnt of buoyant steel, a strange magical alloy, far lighter than it had any right to be. Ever since then [PAWN_pronoun] has worked towards becoming a master at working buoyant steel. This proved to be difficult, as buoyant steel is not easy to come by, but eventually [PAWN_nameDef] got there, crafting a cuirass that rivalled ebony in quality.\n\nAnything [PAWN_nameDef] crafts out of buoyant steel will be one quality level higher than normal.</baseDescription>

		<titleShort>master smith</titleShort>
		<baseDescription>One of [PAWN_nameDef]'s ancestors was a rather skilled moonstone smith, back when the Maormer were still Aldmer. Though some has been lost to time, this knowledge has been passed down the generations, eventually being passed to [PAWN_nameDef].\n\nThere is a chance that anything [PAWN_nameDef] crafts out of moonstone will be one quality level higher than normal.</baseDescription>
